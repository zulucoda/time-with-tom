# Time with Tom
Tom is a popular guy and therefore everyone wants to book time with Tom. So I built a time booking web app for Tom. This web app allows Tom to manage all his social interaction.

1. Users can access Tomâ€™s schedule, and they can see when Tom is available for bookings.
1. Then users can capture a booking request with the following:
* date
* time
* an activity they want to do with Tom
* name
* surname
* email

**Time with Tom uses the following:**
* React
* Formik
* React-Router
* React Material-ui

**Architecture - future features**
* make a new booking request
    - display activity - activity is the product which determines what the form should render.
    - select an activity
    - display single user booking:
        * user details
        * booking details
        * Payment Option (for some activities)
        * submit button
    - display multiple users booking:
        * multiple users details
        * booking details
        * Payment Option
        * submit button

**Workflow**
* activity-workflow ({...options}) => 
    - component -> activity
    - payload -> values -> ()
    - validate -> values -> ()
    - initialValues

**isWorkflowActive**
Each workflow will have a field that is isWorkflowActive_workflowname = true That way the feature formik will be able to disable workflows in their business rules by deactivating or activating a workflow. Then the flow is itself will allow itself to check its own active value and this will determine whether it should proceed with rendering, validate and payload mapping.

**payment workflow**
Initially display credit card details
Later on, we may expand payment details to support more options via sub-workflows - part 2 of the blog post
